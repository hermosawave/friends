	<h1>Empty Kyoto: 10/7 Update</h1>
	   <div class="text">
         <p>Hi everyone:</p>

<p>Thanks again for your Kickstarter support. It’s been a little while since my last report, but there’s been a lot going on. So let me get you up-to-date!</p>

<h3 id="the-book-is-getting-closer-and-closer">The book is getting closer and closer.</h3>

	<figcaption><span>Left: trimmed, folded pages. Right: the book mockup. Behind: 8 pages on a sheet, as the book comes out of the printer.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Friday, I visited SunM Color again. I received a printout of every page in the book, on the new thicker paper, trimmed and folded to simulate the actual book, from the large 8-up sheets it is printed on.</p>

<p>The thicker paper is not much thicker, but it’s a big improvement in the feel. And for a real book, the touch and feel is important, wouldn’t you agree?</p>

<p>As I looked closer, I was astonished at how sharp the images looked. I’ve been making my calendars (more on this in a second) for 17 years, using a short run print–on–demand process, and I’ve been very pleased with the quality. But this book is something else! Really sharp!</p>

<p>Mr. Osaka from SunM also gave me a copy of the bound book mockup, exactly as it will be – but without any printing. I had already reconciled myself to the fact that the book would be not be all that large, so the final size is pretty much what I expected. It feels good, the cover is fairly solid, the pages lie flat. The many double-page photos in the book will look great. Then there will be the heavy, coated paper dust jacket surrounding it. I think it will be great.</p>

	<figcaption><span>Close up on the lay flat binding</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next is that final check, adjust a few photos, and finish up the cover. This should be done within the next week.</p>

<p>The digital PDF version is waiting on the cover. So after the cover is finished, the PDF version can be finalized. I think the digital PDF version can ship by October 20.</p>

<h3 id="return-your-rewards-shipment-survey">Return your rewards shipment survey!</h3>

<p>Speaking of shipping, I have sent the Kickstarter rewards (aka, the book ;-) shipping survey out to everyone. You need to return it (or all of them, if you received more than one) before I can ship your order. If you can’t find it in your inbox or junk folder, I think you can fill out the survey by logging into your Kickstarter account.</p>

<h2 id="2024-calendar">2024 Calendar</h2>
<figure>

<p>Speaking of the calendar, I am happy to announce that the 2024 calendar is also at the (different, on–demand) printer, with a much faster turnaround. I’ve been gushing about the book’s quality, but the calendar will look good too, same as last year’s. Not as good as the book, but it’s also hanging on your wall, not sitting on your desk, so the quality difference should be acceptable. I’m hoping to have them this Saturday, the 14th of October.</p>

<s>The international shipping situation still sucks, but if you order now, the two month voyage by sea will still get to you before Christmas. </s>
<p>The international shipping situation has improved. A lower price Printed Matter postal rate, by air and with tracking has reappeared as an option. As a result , most of the initial shipment of books arrived within 14 days.</p>

<p>Those of you getting a calendar and a book with your Kickstarter will get them shipped together by air. If you didn’t order a calendar on the Kickstarter campaign but would like one now, you can order at this link. You can select “Will Call” for the Shipping Location, and I will add it to your book order, shipping at the beginning of December. I am discussing rates with several of the international air shipping companies and should make a decision in the next few days which one I will use.</p>

<p>This year‘s theme is “Images of Japan.” There are photos from as far north as Akita Prefecture, to Miyazaki Prefecture in Kyushu in the south. Many of the photos are pastoral photos of nature, the better to look at all month.</p>

<h3 id="my-previous-life-revisited">My Previous Life, revisited.</h3>

<p>In one of my previous lives, I was a musician and beat box guru. Some things about my work in the 80’s have popped up recently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An album of synth tracks called Traces of Illusion features my recording of “Dewdrops.” This version was recorded for Oberheim Electronics, the synthesizer maker where I worked. <a href="https://spacetalkmusic.bandcamp.com/track/dewdrops">Listen here…</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>*An Instagram story by the Los Angeles Times talks about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxtzhwtpPUH/">me and my work with Dr. Dre.</a> If you’re interested in the track that Oberheim used as hold music, it was track I created to demonstrate the sounds of the DMX drum machine, which I digitized and edited whilke working at Oberheim. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hermosawave/dmx">You can listen here on SoundCloud.</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve worked in a number of creative endeavors during my life. They have all been places at the intersection of art and technology; where new technology is used for creative purposes. My photography and publishing are just the latest manifestations.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s that latest news. Hope you have a great weekend!</p>

<p>Regards, Daniel</p>
