<p>Hi folks!</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest empty Kyoto book update. Thanksgiving is a uniquely American holiday, so in Japan things jump from Halloween directly to Christmas. And since the important holiday by far is New Year‚Äôs, all the Christmas decorations vanish as soon as Santa‚Äôs sled disappears over the horizon. So they like to get an early start on Christmas, and things are already in full Ho, Ho, Ho mode.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been about a month since the last update, my apologies.  However, I wanted to wait until I had more concrete information to pass along. And now I have it!</p>

<p>The last remaining unresolved element in the book was the cover. My printer and I went back-and-forth several times before they achieved a print of cover that I liked. It was mostly color issues: <em>‚ÄúIt looks great on my screen, why can‚Äôt you make it like that?‚Äù</em> Those of you with any experience in print publishing are smiling right now, because color matching between screen and print is one of the main challenges of printing on paper.</p>

<p>Anyway, that was solved about two weeks ago, and after that it was ‚ÄúAll Systems Go!‚Äù as we waited for <em>liftoff</em>.</p>

<p>Today I received notice from the printer that the books were printed and were in the process of being packaged for shipping. The books will be delivered next Tuesday, November 28! And then I get to send them to all to you!</p>

<p>Hundreds of shipping boxes arrived yesterday, and I need to pick up a few other packaging items so we can be ready for shipping as soon as the books arrive.</p>

<p>Weeks ago I sent surveys from Kickstarter via email to confirm your shipping address. If you haven‚Äôt sent it in yet, please do so at your earliest convenience. Orders without shipping addresses obviously cannot be shipped, and I will not be able to follow up until all the other orders are out.</p>

<p>Most USA orders will ship via Kuroneko Yamato/UPS. this means Yamato (Japan‚Äôs largest shipping company, I think) will get the shipments into the United States, then hand them off to UPS for  delivery. I‚Äôm not sure how this works into Europe or other countries, I‚Äôll have to check. My test shipments to the USA took about one week door-to-door. The shipments are trackable on the Yamato website, and I think they will also be trackable on the UPS site. I will forward tracking information as I get it.</p>

<p>Within Japan, packages will go via Kuroneko as well.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure how many shipments I can put together each day ‚Äì somewhere between 20 and 50 per day. So it will take several days to get all the orders out. In the address request survey form, I asked if your order was a gift. The gifts will go first.</p>

<p>I think as long as orders are shipped by December 15, they should arrive in time for Christmas, so there should be adequate time. Hanukkah on the other hand is early this year, so I hope shipments will arrive by the end of the festival, but no guarantees.</p>

<p><em>So there you have it. </em></p>

<p>I am preparing for delivery on Tuesday in order to make the shipping process as fast and orderly as possible. I know it will actually be chaos, but I‚Äôm trying to control it as much as possible. üòÄ</p>

<p>Hopefully the next message you get from me will have your tracking number in it!</p>

<p>I am also planning this to be the last email you get from Kickstarter. I am going to transition to a new membership website, and everyone who backed the Empty Kyoto project will get their first year membership for free. It‚Äôs a way of expressing my gratitude for your support of the Empty Kyoto project.</p>

<p>The new membership website will offer discounts on art prints, calendars, and future books (if there are any üòÖ) as well as behind the scenes stories of my photographs and life in Japan. And maybe more‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Once again, my thanks for supporting the project and staying with me until the end.</p>

<p>All the best,</p>

<p>Daniel</p>
