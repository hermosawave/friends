	<h1>The end of a Thrilling Year!</h1>
	   <div class="text">
         <p>Well here we are folks! The end of a thrilling year, and the end of the publishing process for the Empty Kyoto book.</p>

<p>The idea for the book germinated in April of this year, fundraising started in July, the layout in August, printing September through November, shipping in December. And now we’re done!</p>

<p>Most all of you have received your books, although there are about a dozen orders still out there, notably shipments to Canada and shipments that went through New York City…

<p>Now  the book is out in the wild and I am seeing images like this one pop up on social media, which generates new orders as well. It’s a great feeling. Thank you.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/emptykyoto/2312_IMG_9226-7.jpg" />
I’m taking a small amount of time off, as everything in Japan closes down between ~December 30 and January 6. Our Osechi New Year’s meal arrived yesterday and is in the refrigerator. Our neighbor, a florist, is super busy preparing all kinds of New Year’s decorations and floral arrangements.</p>

<p>Thanks again for coming on this ride with me this year. There is more to come as I continue to promote the book and prepare for a gallery exhibit April 13-21 in Kyoto, as part of the Kyotographie International Photography festival. (More to come on this)</p>

<p>In January, I’ll be going back to California, followed by a trip to Seattle and Kansas to see my family, before returning to Kyoto in mid-March.</p>

<p>If you’re in the US and are interested in books or the 2024 calendars, I will be able to send them from California, saving time and money on the shipping. I have updated the website with the new pricing, effective until mid March.</p>

<p>I’m still experimenting with this newsletter and the supporters’ website, too. I started using Substack, which was okay, but I left because of their business practices. I moved to Ghost, which was also okay, but I wasn’t happy with their membership features. So now I’m using Memberful; here the membership features are good, but the newsletter/blogging features are lacking – actually they encourage you to host your newsletter and website elsewhere.
I want more visual control of… well everything. All of these sites, by appealing to people with no web design experience, lock you into such a generic vanilla look, like this newsletter you’re reading now. It’s boring.</p>

<p>I’ve also moved the online purchasing component from Square to Stripe. I love Square for in-person transactions and have used them since they first launched in 2011. I have also used Stripe on and off for many years. Stripe is more web-focused and developer-centric, so a little harder to set up, but much better for the web in terms of localized user experience. I have customers all over the world and Stripe just feels better.  I suppose something like Shopify might be the best online shopping solution, but I only have two products (the book and the calendar) and it seems like overkill to maintain a full blown online store. I already have a separare online photo gallery using SmugMug. It’s too much.</p>

<p>So things are still in flux. (Just like everything else in the world.)</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been doing a number of things with Kyoto Journal, which if you don’t already know about you really should take a look at. A photo from Empty Kyoto is on the cover of the current issue, 105 and there is a feature about my book. I’ve been writing an article about Bagels &amp; Sushi for their next issue, Cultural Fluidity, 106; and I’ve been shooting a lot of photos to accompany several articles in the following issue, Fire &amp; Kyoto, 107, coming in the spring. There are very few magazines devoted to Japanese culture in English, and I’ve been reading the magazine for years. I used to visit the Kinokuniya book store in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, to get the latest issues. So it’s a privilege to be able to work with them now.</p>

<p>I guess that’s about it. Best wishes for a safe and enjoyable holiday and the best of luck in 2024. We’ll need it.</p>

<p>– Daniel</p>
