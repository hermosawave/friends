<p>Dear Kickstarter and other supporters, this is Daniel, escaping the almost freezing weather in Kyoto for the warmer Southern California climate. This week has been wonderfully, unseasonably warm, but it rained a lot last week and will rain a lot more in the next few days. Such is the ”rainy season” in LA.</p>

<p>I’m here in LA for another month, re-learning how to drive to a place to walk, rather than just walking to it as we do in Japan. I love driving our electric vehicles in California, but at the same time, when I’m in Japan I don’t miss not having a car.</p>

<p>With all the buzz about Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto joining the Los Angeles Dodgers, a large mural of Ohtani and Mookie Betts of the Dodgers, along with LA Kings hockey players Drew Dougherty and Dustin Brown in their 2014 Stanley Cup finest has been popping up in my social media feeds. The other day I was able to find it – at the border of Hermosa and Manhattan Beach, not far from where many of these pro athletes live. (There is evidently another mural of the Lakers basketball team nearby, which is why they are not included in this one.)</p>

<h2 id="friends">Friends</h2>

<p>I’ve been working hard to get your Supporters VIP website up and running, and now I’m ready to introduce it to you!</p>

<p>It’s called Friends of Hermosawave Photography and it’s located at <a href="https://friends.hermosawavephotography.com" target="_blank">https://friends.hermosawavephotography.com</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a link at the bottom of the main photography site.</p>

<p>We’re just getting started, but what I have so far is:
Nice discounts on books and calendars, as well as custom prints and other things in my printshop. 
Computer and iPhone screen background wallpapers. These will probably change seasonally.
There is also a complete archive of all the newsletter posts I’ve been doing the past few years. 
Please take a look and let me know if you have any comments, or anything you’d like to see.</p>

<p>Another thing I’m working on is sending my daily Picture of the Day posting to you via email. The photos already get syndicated to all the social networks, but maybe emails are a way to simplify our lives. I’ve researched enough to know this is possible, now I just need to build it.</p>

<p>One of the trends I’m perceiving in 2024 is the desire is to get away from all the algorithms and take back our lives; our news, our media, our social activity.</p>

<p>Among other things, It means subscribing to and supporting individual authors; rather than mainstream media – which right now are having trouble deciding whether to promote the truth or their billionaire owners’ priorities.</p>

<p>Anyway I’m a firm believer in independent voices and independent creative people.</p>

<p>To build this membership site I’m giving all of you Kickstarter backers a free year membership – then at the end of the year let’s see if it’s worth your - and my - continued investment.</p>

<p>Your subscription is maintained at Memberful. You are already subscribed, but you can change your email address or add a credit card for future payment. You’ll see a membership sign-in link in the footer of the Friends pages that takes you to the Memberful website. Your login is the email address you used in Kickstarter, and they will email you a “magic” link to sign in with; you can also set up a password if you prefer.</p>

<p>And if you want nothing to do with any of this, you can unsubscribe and we’ll go on without you.</p>

<p>Anyway that’s all for now. Take a look and let me know what you think!</p>

<p>Best,
Daniel</p>

<p>An update on my Nikon film camera post.</p>

<p>I love using the Nikon FM3a camera I bought last summer, but film is not very useful in my workflow.</p>

<figure>
   <img src="/assets/images/theshot/2309_DSCF9132.jpg" />

</figure>

<p>The premise of my Picture of the Day photoblog - that I started over 20 years ago - was to post one good picture <em>that had been taken that very day</em>. This was a new concept at the time, and I was able to use it to my advantage.</p>

<p>Film’s weeks-long delay between shooting and having a file in my hand doesn’t work very well in this context. I enjoy using my film camera and the slides look great, but digital is so much easier, faster, and overall better. I guess this is the evaluation most other people have made these past 20 years.</p>

<p>These manual focus Ai Nikkor lenses have been seeing a lot of use on my Sony digital camera, however. In fact I’ve purchased a few more of these lenses. They have some interesting idiosyncrasies which can add additional flavoring to an image.</p>

<figure>
   <img src="/assets/images/theshot/2401_A7R07016-HDR.jpg" />
    <figcaption><span>Chromatic aberration and lens flare from the Ai Nikkor 85mm f/2 lens create a rainbow of colors under the Manhattan Beach, CA pier. Shot using Sony a7r iii.</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I abandoned manual focus when I was trying to take photos of my energetic little kid back in the 90s. But now that he’s grown and I’m back to shooting things that don’t move much, using manual focus is great. It forces you to slow down and pay more attention. I even use manual focus on my iPhone sometimes, with the Halide camera app I usually shoot with.</p>

<p>Slide scanning is not yet optimum, but with the AI tools we have in modern photo software, I can sharpen the image, reduce noise, and generally improve the photograph, just like with a digital camera. Yet film retains its unique softness and coloring. It gives images a vintage, 20th Century look.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption><span>Looking at Kyoto Tower from Kyoto Station across the street. - Fujifilm Velvia 100</span></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The other issue I have - shooting film and also using the film lenses on digital - is metadata. With autofocus lenses there are electrical connections between the lens and camera, so at the moment of exposure the camera knows which lens is being used as well as the focus and aperture settings, and it saves them in the EXIF metadata within the photo file - along with current time, camera model, shutter speed, ISO setting, and even location. A film camera records none of that information. So, trying to remember what settings or even which lens was used, is in part observation, memory and guesswork.</p>

<p>Then before uploading files to my website, I need to edit the metadata in order to add those items which were not recorded. My website displays the exposure data right from the photo file, so I need to embed proper information so it gets displayed properly. Most editing software like Photoshop or Lightroom will not allow you to change the exposure metadata, also though you can add other metadata, such as a title, caption or keyword. So I have to resort to some other rather amateurish software to accomplish this.</p>

</figure>

<p>So, am I glad I did this film experiment? Yes. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoy the uncomputerized, optical feel of this camera. I just need to remember to wind the film. 😄</p>

<p>But the lenses were the big surprise in all of this.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Behind the Shot" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An Arashiyama restaurant. - Fujifilm Velvia 100]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Greetings from Kyoto</title><link href="https://friends.hermosawavephotography.com/members/behind%20the%20shot/2024/01/06/greetings-from-kyoto.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Greetings from Kyoto" /><published>2024-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://friends.hermosawavephotography.com/members/behind%20the%20shot/2024/01/06/greetings-from-kyoto</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://friends.hermosawavephotography.com/members/behind%20the%20shot/2024/01/06/greetings-from-kyoto.html"><![CDATA[<figure>

<p>Daniel Sofer, photographer here in Kyoto, Japan, wishing you the best for the New Year!</p>

<p>My wife and I celebrated New Year’s in Kyoto by going to Yasaka Jinja on New Year’s Eve. In the morning we ate from a French cuisine inspired Osechi, followed by the first shrine visit (hatsumode) at the Kitano Tenmangu shrine.</p>

<p>This was followed by extensive file backups on the computer, to prepare for a new year of photos and posts. </p>

<p>Considering that everything is traditionally closed for several days, I was quite surprised at how many restaurants and markets were open. Well, some of these places near the shrines experience pedestrian traffic on New Year’s Day far beyond that of a normal day, and it makes economic sense for them to stay open.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon we were treated to a long episode of gentle rocking – almost a lullaby - by the Earth. It was an earthquake in Ishikawa Prefecture, which is a long way from Kyoto. It was a very big earthquake there, that we felt hundreds of miles away.</p>

<p>Actually it’s been a while since I felt an earthquake. I have experienced larger quakes in Los Angeles, but like I said, the epicenter was 175 miles away so I doubt the folks in Kanazawa or the Noto Peninsula used such gentle romantic descriptions as I have used here. </p>

<p>Now that 2023 is in the books, it’s time to look forward to 2024. We will escape the borderline freezing weather in Kyoto for Los Angeles where the temperatures are in the 60s (rather than 30s) for about six weeks, Then we’ll visit family in Seattle and Kansas City, before returning to Kyoto in March.</p>

<p>I have a gallery exhibit of prints from the Empty Kyoto book lined up for mid April so I have a lot of preparation to do once I get back.</p>

<p>The book that I made last year is doing well. Most all my Kickstarter backers have received their books, and I’m getting new orders almost every day.</p>

<p>So on that happy note, I wish you a healthy and happy new year!</p>

The end of a thrilling year, and the end of the publishing process for the Empty Kyoto book.</p>

<p>The idea for the book germinated in April of this year, fundraising started in July, the layout in August, printing September through November, shipping in December. And now we’re done!</p>

<p>Most all of you have received your books, although there are about a dozen orders still out there, notably shipments to Canada and shipments that went through New York City…</p>
<figure class="max-width"><img src="/assets/images/emptykyoto/409544665_10159980452783263_8257483572849494193_n.jpg" /><figcaption>(Photo courtesy of William Susman)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Now the book is out in the wild and I am seeing images like this one pop up on social media, which generates new orders as well. It’s a great feeling. Thank you.</p>

<p>I’m taking a small amount of time off, as everything in Japan closes down between ~December 30 and January 6. Our Osechi New Year’s meal arrived yesterday and is in the refrigerator. Our neighbor, a florist, is super busy preparing all kinds of New Year’s decorations and floral arrangements.</p>

<figure><img src="/assets/images/emptykyoto/2312_IMG_9226-7.jpg" /></figure>

<p>Thanks again for coming on this ride with me this year. There is more to come as I continue to promote the book and prepare for a gallery exhibit April 13-21 in Kyoto, as part of the Kyotographie International Photography festival. (More to come on this)</p>

<p>In January, I’ll be going back to California, followed by a trip to Seattle and Kansas to see my family, before returning to Kyoto in mid-March.</p>

<p>If you’re in the US and are interested in books or the 2024 calendars, I will be able to send them from California, saving time and money on the shipping. I have updated the website with the new pricing, effective until mid March.</p>

<p>I’m still experimenting with this newsletter and the supporters’ website, too. I started using Substack, which was okay, but I left because of their business practices. I moved to Ghost, which was also okay, but I wasn’t happy with their membership features. So now I’m using Memberful; here the membership features are good, but the newsletter/blogging features are lacking – actually they encourage you to host your newsletter and website elsewhere.</p>

<p>I want more visual control of… well everything. All of these sites, by appealing to people with no web design experience, lock you into such a generic vanilla look, like this newsletter you’re reading now. It’s boring.</p>

<p>I’ve also moved the online purchasing component from Square to Stripe. I love Square for in-person transactions and have used them since they first launched in 2011. I have also used Stripe on and off for many years. Stripe is more web-focused and developer-centric, so a little harder to set up, but much better for the web in terms of localized user experience. I have customers all over the world and Stripe just feels better.  I suppose something like Shopify might be the best online shopping solution, but I only have two products (the book and the calendar) and it seems like overkill to maintain a full blown online store. I already have a separate online printshop using SmugMug.  <em> It’s too much. </em></p>

<p><strong>So things are still in flux. </strong> (Just like everything else in the world.)</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve been doing a number of things with <a href="http://kyotojournal.org/" target="blank"><strong>Kyoto Journal</strong></a>, which if you don’t already know about you really should take a look at. A photo from Empty Kyoto is on the cover of the current issue, 105 and there is a feature about my book. I’ve been writing an article about Bagels &amp; Sushi for their  issue, Cultural Fluidity, <s>106</s> 108; and I’ve been shooting a lot of photos to accompany several articles in the following issue, Fire &amp; Kyoto, 107, coming in the spring. There are very few magazines devoted to Japanese culture in English, and I’ve been reading the magazine for years. I used to visit the Kinokuniya book store in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, to get the latest issues. So it’s a privilege to be able to work with them now.</p>

<p>I guess that’s about it. Best wishes for a safe and enjoyable holiday and the best of luck in 2024. We’ll need it.</p>

<p>Hi folks:</p>

<p>After 10 days, we’ve shipped about 2/3 of the orders. Any reward of more than a single book has already been shipped.</p>

<p>Tracking the packages, I can see that the first, most time-sensitive ones have already been delivered. The other shipments have either arrived in the destination country, or are through customs and waiting for a flight out of Osaka’s Kansai airport. For the US, “destination country” often means Fairbanks, Alaska, so it will take a few more days to get to you.</p>

<p>If I have shipped your reward, you will have already received an email with a tracking link.</p>

<p>I have been prioritizing USA shipments up to now, the vast majority of rewards. Starting Monday, I will prioritize UK/EU shipments. Shipments within Japan will go last, as most will be delivered the day after shipment.</p>

<p>I have plenty of boxes, but one thing that has become problematic is obtaining enough intermediate envelopes to go into the boxes. I’m going to have to get more creative with the packaging!</p>

<p>Anyway, you’ll get your books soon! I hope you enjoy them. And don’t be shy sharing photos on social media, I love seeing them!</p>

<p>Have a great weekend!</p>

<p>Hi folks:</p>

<p>A little update to let you know that the books have arrived, they are being packaged and shipped now.</p>

<p>The book looks great! However it looks just like all the individual pieces I have previously received, so my reaction was more one of relief than excitement, to be honest.</p>

<p>I’m hoping the get all the Kickstarter orders out within the next week.</p>

<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Daniel</p>

<p>Hi folks!</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest empty Kyoto book update. Thanksgiving is a uniquely American holiday, so in Japan things jump from Halloween directly to Christmas. And since the important holiday by far is New Year’s, all the Christmas decorations vanish as soon as Santa’s sled disappears over the horizon. So they like to get an early start on Christmas, and things are already in full Ho, Ho, Ho mode.</p>

<p>It’s been about a month since the last update, my apologies.  However, I wanted to wait until I had more concrete information to pass along. And now I have it!</p>

<p>The last remaining unresolved element in the book was the cover. My printer and I went back-and-forth several times before they achieved a print of cover that I liked. It was mostly color issues: <em>“It looks great on my screen, why can’t you make it like that?”</em> Those of you with any experience in print publishing are smiling right now, because color matching between screen and print is one of the main challenges of printing on paper.</p>

<p>Anyway, that was solved about two weeks ago, and after that it was “All Systems Go!” as we waited for <em>liftoff</em>.</p>

<p>Today I received notice from the printer that the books were printed and were in the process of being packaged for shipping. The books will be delivered next Tuesday, November 28! And then I get to send them to all to you!</p>

<p>Hundreds of shipping boxes arrived yesterday, and I need to pick up a few other packaging items so we can be ready for shipping as soon as the books arrive.</p>

<p>Weeks ago I sent surveys from Kickstarter via email to confirm your shipping address. If you haven’t sent it in yet, please do so at your earliest convenience. Orders without shipping addresses obviously cannot be shipped, and I will not be able to follow up until all the other orders are out.</p>

<p>Most USA orders will ship via Kuroneko Yamato/UPS. this means Yamato (Japan’s largest shipping company, I think) will get the shipments into the United States, then hand them off to UPS for  delivery. I’m not sure how this works into Europe or other countries, I’ll have to check. My test shipments to the USA took about one week door-to-door. The shipments are trackable on the Yamato website, and I think they will also be trackable on the UPS site. I will forward tracking information as I get it.</p>

<p>Within Japan, packages will go via Kuroneko as well.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how many shipments I can put together each day – somewhere between 20 and 50 per day. So it will take several days to get all the orders out. In the address request survey form, I asked if your order was a gift. The gifts will go first.</p>

<p>I think as long as orders are shipped by December 15, they should arrive in time for Christmas, so there should be adequate time. Hanukkah on the other hand is early this year, so I hope shipments will arrive by the end of the festival, but no guarantees.</p>

<p><em>So there you have it. </em></p>

<p>I am preparing for delivery on Tuesday in order to make the shipping process as fast and orderly as possible. I know it will actually be chaos, but I’m trying to control it as much as possible. 😀</p>

<p>Hopefully the next message you get from me will have your tracking number in it!</p>

<p>I am also planning this to be the last email you get from Kickstarter. I am going to transition to a new membership website, and everyone who backed the Empty Kyoto project will get their first year membership for free. It’s a way of expressing my gratitude for your support of the Empty Kyoto project.</p>

<p>The new membership website will offer discounts on art prints, calendars, and future books (if there are any 😅) as well as behind the scenes stories of my photographs and life in Japan. And maybe more…</p>

<p>Once again, my thanks for supporting the project and staying with me until the end.</p>

<p>All the best,</p>

<p>Actually, things are kind of quiet right now. The eye of the storm, I guess.</p>

<p>I have signed off on the inside of the book, which means no more changes or approvals. The printer is “full speed ahead” on production.</p>

<p>I am waiting for proofs for the cover and dust jacket. I think I will receive them in the next few days. Update: I received the proofs yesterday. I asked for some changes to the color photo on the front cover (dust jacket). I think this will set things back a week, but maybe not. What takes the longest is the book itself - which I already approved - not the jacket.</p>

<p>Some have been sent out, many are waiting to go along with the books. If you’d like one you can order at this link. Choose “Will Call” shipping and I will include it with your book.</p>

<p>I’ve acquired boxes, wrapping, and other packaging for both the books and calendars, and I think I have a configuration that will be efficient as well as visually appealing.</p>

<p>What I’ve mostly been doing the past few days is organizing the shipping itself. I set up business accounts with a few express shipping companies, and today I sent several test shipments to find out the following things:</p>

<p>How easy it is to ship a package internationally, can I do everything online or do I need to go someplace to fill out those multipart forms?
Is the actual price they charge me is the same as their price list?
How soon do they actually deliver?
For the past 5 years or so I’ve been using JP Post (aka “the post office”) exclusively. But JP Post’s service really suffered during the pandemic, the lack of flights made things difficult. The US Postal Service has also made shipping to the US more difficult and expensive, by removing services that used to be available and by instituting more complex requirements. I sent a package last month by EMS (Express Mail) that JP Post says takes three days; it took seven days. Still figuring this out. But I have another month to get organized, so I have time to experiment before committing.</p>

<p>If you’ve got one on order, you should have received a download link. If you didn’t please let me know. If would like a digital PDF version of the book, you can order here.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s it for now.</p>

<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>Thanks again for your Kickstarter support. It’s been a little while since my last report, but there’s been a lot going on. So let me get you up-to-date!</p>

<h3 id="the-book-is-getting-closer-and-closer">The book is getting closer and closer.</h3>

</figure>

<p>Friday, I visited SunM Color again. I received a printout of every page in the book, on the new thicker paper, trimmed and folded to simulate the actual book, from the large 8-up sheets it is printed on.</p>

<p>The thicker paper is not much thicker, but it’s a big improvement in the feel. And for a real book, the touch and feel is important, wouldn’t you agree?</p>

<p>As I looked closer, I was astonished at how sharp the images looked. I’ve been making my calendars (more on this in a second) for 17 years, using a short run print–on–demand process, and I’ve been very pleased with the quality. But this book is something else! Really sharp!</p>

</figure>
<p>Mr. Osaka from SunM also gave me a copy of the bound book mockup, exactly as it will be – but without any printing. I had already reconciled myself to the fact that the book would be not be all that large, so the final size is pretty much what I expected. It feels good, the cover is fairly solid, the pages lie flat. The many double-page photos in the book will look great. Then there will be the heavy, coated paper dust jacket surrounding it. I think it will be great.</p>

<p>Next is that final check, adjust a few photos, and finish up the cover. This should be done within the next week.</p>

<p>The digital PDF version is waiting on the cover. So after the cover is finished, the PDF version can be finalized. I think the digital PDF version can ship by October 20.</p>

<h3 id="return-your-rewards-shipment-survey">Return your rewards shipment survey!</h3>

<p>Speaking of shipping, I have sent the Kickstarter rewards (aka, the book ;-) shipping survey out to everyone. You need to return it (or all of them, if you received more than one) before I can ship your order. If you can’t find it in your inbox or junk folder, I think you can fill out the survey by logging into your Kickstarter account.</p>

<h2 id="2024-calendar">2024 Calendar</h2>

<p>Speaking of the calendar, I am happy to announce that the 2024 calendar is also at the (different, on–demand) printer, with a much faster turnaround. I’ve been gushing about the book’s quality, but the calendar will look good too, same as last year’s. Not as good as the book, but it’s also hanging on your wall, not sitting on your desk, so the quality difference should be acceptable. I’m hoping to have them this Saturday, the 14th of October.</p>

<s>The international shipping situation still sucks, but if you order now, the two month voyage by sea will still get to you before Christmas. </s>
<p>The international shipping situation has improved. A lower price Printed Matter postal rate, by air and with tracking has reappeared as an option. As a result , most of the initial shipment of books arrived within 14 days.</p>

<p>Those of you getting a calendar and a book with your Kickstarter will get them shipped together by air. If you didn’t order a calendar on the Kickstarter campaign but would like one now, you can order at this link. You can select “Will Call” for the Shipping Location, and I will add it to your book order, shipping at the beginning of December. I am discussing rates with several of the international air shipping companies and should make a decision in the next few days which one I will use.</p>

<p>This year‘s theme is “Images of Japan.” There are photos from as far north as Akita Prefecture, to Miyazaki Prefecture in Kyushu in the south. Many of the photos are pastoral photos of nature, the better to look at all month.</p>

<h3 id="my-previous-life-revisited">My Previous Life, revisited.</h3>

<p>In one of my previous lives, I was a musician and beat box guru. Some things about my work in the 80’s have popped up recently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An album of synth tracks called Traces of Illusion features my recording of “Dewdrops.” This version was recorded for Oberheim Electronics, the synthesizer maker where I worked. <a href="https://spacetalkmusic.bandcamp.com/track/dewdrops">Listen here…</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>*An Instagram story by the Los Angeles Times talks about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxtzhwtpPUH/">me and my work with Dr. Dre.</a> If you’re interested in the track that Oberheim used as hold music, it was track I created to demonstrate the sounds of the DMX drum machine, which I digitized and edited whilke working at Oberheim. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hermosawave/dmx">You can listen here on SoundCloud.</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve worked in a number of creative endeavors during my life. They have all been places at the intersection of art and technology; where new technology is used for creative purposes. My photography and publishing are just the latest manifestations.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s that latest news. Hope you have a great weekend!</p>

<p>It started when I moved to Kyoto. I began noticing people carrying film cameras.</p>
<p>Even with all the talk of retro analog technology making a comeback, you don&#x2019;t see it so much in Los Angeles. In LA, film has been dead for a long time. All the pros that wax nostalgic about the days of film make their living shooting digital.</p><p>But Kyoto&#x2019;s culture is different. Here it&#x2019;s about craftsmanship, and passing on those traditional techniques that seem endangered nowadays.</p><p>A few years ago I worked at <a href="https://www.kyotographie.jp/en/?ref=blog.hermosawavephotography.com">Kyotographie</a>, Kyoto&#x2019;s annual international photography festival. And of course, at a photography festival you&#x2019;re going to have a lot of photographers touring the exhibits. So there were lots of people with serious cameras hanging off their shoulders. But what was surprising to me was that half of them seemed to be film cameras. I was shocked.</p><p>That&#x2019;s what sparked my interest in something I left behind 20 years before. My photography blog has been going for more than 20 years now, and the <a href="https://hermosawavephotography.com/210/?ref=blog.hermosawavephotography.com">last post shot with film</a> was in 2003.</p><p>My first digital camera was a small Casio in the late 90s that took postage stamp sized pictures of less than even one megapixel. A dozen digital cameras later I&#x2019;m very happy with the Sony a7r3 I&#x2019;ve been using since 2018. And I&#x2019;ve gradually moved to prime lenses that don&#x2019;t zoom. To paraphrase Mari Kondo, I want things I use to bring me joy.</p><p>But gradually the idea of a film camera started looking attractive. I decided I needed to take a deeper look. As I researched, I realized that an investment of $1000 would get me a great 35mm film camera and a few lenses. So that&#x2019;s what I did this summer.</p><p>Size and especially weight are important considerations for me, so I wanted small and light. I decided on the Nikon FM3a, the final model in a series of small robust manual focus cameras Nikon made starting in the late 70s. Nikon had several film cameras in production when they shut down their ENTIRE film business in 2006. This model was in production until then, so it&apos;s one of the last film cameras Nikon made, certainly the last manual focus model. And even though it&#x2019;s the newest one, it&#x2019;s still 20 years old. The lenses are even older, 20 to 40 years old.</p><p>I went to Fujiya Camera in Nakano, Tokyo to look for this hard to find Nikon camera. I told myself, <em>&quot;if it feels good to me, I&#x2019;ll buy it.&quot;</em></p><p>I say that, because a couple of years earlier I took a look at a Hasselblad medium format camera &#x2013; one of the most respected cameras in the world - and it was so alien to me, I could not get to any kind of comfort level in the minutes I spent playing with it.</p><p>So I went to the camera store and inquired about this FM3a model. Although it&#x2019;s a hard to find model they had half a dozen black camera bodies to choose from. They all looked brand new. It was amazing. </p><p>So I picked up the camera. It was small in the hand, and much lighter than expected. I was astounded. Weren&#x2019;t mirrorless camera supposed to be smaller because the entire mirror box viewfinder system was removed? This camera is smaller than my mirrorless Sony. And the lenses? So much smaller than my Sony lenses &#x2013; and each was only $150 bucks! (my favorite Sony 35mm f/1.4 lens cost $1800!)</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I put the viewfinder up to my eye. I momentarily forgot how those old cameras worked. But it felt good, really good in my hands. So I pulled the trigger for the camera, lenses, some Fujichrome slide film, and headed out.</p>
<p>35mm, 50mm, 85mm lenses and the camera body &#x2013; all from the golden age of Nikon and all in practically new condition &#x2013; for a bit more than a grand ($1200).</p>
<figure><img src="https://blog.hermosawavephotography.com/content/images/2023/09/2309_DSCF9106-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"  ></figure>

<p>After my experiences in the past, I wondered, &#x201C;Could I actually shoot photos, in focus and properly exposed, with a film camera?&#x201D; The answer from my first roll of film was a resounding yes. I could shoot sharp images, properly exposed, even on unforgiving slide film.</p>
<p>The first box of slides I got back from the photo lab were great to look at, but revealed a major problem with this endeavor &#x2013; how do I get these images into my digital workflow? I&#x2019;m hesitant to spend another $1000 on a macro lens or a film scanner just to take digital pictures of the slides. So I spent $25 on a set of close-up extension tubes instead. That got me some images I could work with.</p>
<p>The second roll of film, I took to a lab that could process the film and scan it for me &#x2013; <em>on a CD</em>. Remember those? It&#x2019;s been years since any of my computers had a CD, but the lab offered to copy the scans onto a flash memory drive if I would bring one &#x2013; and I was thrilled they would do that for me. Something about Japanese customer service. &#x1F609;</p>
<p>So I got my scans. I opened them up in Adobe Lightroom and&#x2026; <em>&#x201C;Hey, these are much smaller than even my iPhone photos.&#x201D;</em> So the quest for good affordable scans continues. Sigh.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m not sure where this is all going to lead. But besides making great images, one of the joys of photography is just looking through the viewfinder and pressing the shutter button. You don&#x2019;t even need to have film in the camera. Just the process of taking a picture is a joy. And that is one thing I&#x2019;m really enjoying with this camera, looking through the viewfinder and pushing the button. With all my cameras, really.</p><p>In the meantime, I bought an adapter to use these old manual focus Ai-S Nikkor lenses on my Sony digital body. <em>Ohhh, now this is getting interesting&#x2026;</em></p>
<p>More to come. &#x1F600;</p>
