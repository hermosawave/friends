Let me know if you notice a difference. I'm still experimenting with this and might move to a California datacenter instead.\n\nFinally is social media, where everything has been in termoil since Elon Musk purchased Twitter. I have moved to Mastodon, where I have several accounts.\n\nI am still syndicating my photos to all the legacy social media: Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, so if you're following me on those services, you'll still see my latest photos. But I do not hangout; I pop in once in a while to check if anything needs my attention. All these social media have been banished to an older \"social media iPhone\" that stays at home.\n\nI still think RSS syndication (using Reader, NetNewswire, Feedbin, or other RSS reading apps) is the best way to get my latest photos without visiting the website. My RSS feed is here (this will look ugly in a regular web browser).\n\nI've also been toying with the idea of delivering the latest Picture of the Day as a daily email, similar to this newsletter. Is that something you've interested in?
